# ðŸŽ¶ HarmonySounds Symphony: A C# Ballad ðŸŽ¶

### **(Verse 1)**
**In the land of code, where dreams are compiled,
C# sings a song, both powerful and mild.
With HarmonySounds, we take a stand,
To register and honor every band.**

### **(Chorus)**
**Oh, C#, your syntax so clean,
In HarmonySounds, our bands are seen.
With notes and albums, we track their fame,
In this symphony, we program their name.**

### **(Verse 2)**
**Classes and methods, our instruments true,
Band and Evaluation, their roles they pursue.
Dictionary of bands, where memories reside,
In HarmonySounds, their tales won't hide.**

### **(Chorus)**
**Oh, C#, your syntax so clean,
In HarmonySounds, our bands are seen.
With notes and albums, we track their fame,
In this symphony, we program their name.**

### **(Bridge)**
**We start with a logo, bright on the screen,
ASCII art shining, in C#'s sheen.
From registration to evaluationâ€™s call,
In HarmonySounds, we capture it all.**

### **(Verse 3)**
**To register a band, the process is clear,
Type in their name, and they'll appear.
To evaluate, just add a score,
In HarmonySounds, their legend will soar.**

### **(Chorus)**
**Oh, C#, your syntax so clean,
In HarmonySounds, our bands are seen.
With notes and albums, we track their fame,
In this symphony, we program their name.**

### **(Outro)**
**As we code and compile, in this musical quest,
In HarmonySounds, we give our best.
C# and our project, a perfect rhyme,
In this melody of code, we'll stand the test of time.**

### **(Final Chorus)**
**Oh, C#, your syntax so clean,
In HarmonySounds, our bands are seen.
With notes and albums, we track their fame,
In this symphony, we program their name.**
